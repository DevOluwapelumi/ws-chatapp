# Real-Time Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application built using **ReactJS**, **WebSocket**, and **Axios** for seamless messaging between users. The app supports dynamic real-time communication, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly without refreshing the page.

## Features:

* **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received instantly using WebSocket, ensuring smooth and quick communication between users.
* **Online/Offline Status**: Users can see if their contacts are online or offline in real-time.
* **Message History**: Users can view the entire conversation history with their selected contact.
* **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Simple and Clean UI**: The interface is intuitive, with a chat window on the right and a contact list on the left, providing a clean and easy-to-use experience.
* **Message Notifications**: Users are notified when a new message arrives, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Technologies Used:

* **ReactJS**: Used for building the user interface.
* **WebSocket**: Used for real-time bidirectional communication between the server and the client.
* **Axios**: Handles HTTP requests for fetching data (e.g., fetching the list of contacts and messages).
* **TailwindCSS**: Used for styling the application with a utility-first CSS framework.
